The default backup retention period is one day if you create the DB instance using the Amazon RDS API or the AWS CLI, 
or seven days if you create the DB instance using the AWS Console.

Amazon RDS does not currently support increasing storage on a ____ Db instance

Block chain - ResourceID.MemberID.NetworkID.managedblockchain.AWSRegion.amazonaws.com:PortNumber

EC2 instances can have credentials stored on them so that the instances can access other resources 
(such as S3 buckets) and AWS recommends that you do this instead of assigning roles.

Can I move a reserved instance from one region to another?

RDS - We highly discourage disabling automated backups because it disables point-in-time recovery.If you disable and then re-enable 
        automated backups,you are only able to restore starting from the time you re-enabled automated backups.
    - In RDS, changes to the backup window take effect
    - In RDS what is the maximum size for a Microsoft SQL Server DB Instance with SQL Server Express edition?
    - By multiAZ we can ensure that the backups doesnt take lag

EC2 - Auto Scaling groups are regional constructs. They can span Availability Zones, but not AWS regions.

    - When an EC2 instance is moved from Running to Hibernate state & back to Running state, 
       there is a change in Public IPv4 address assigned to EC2 instance while no change in Private IPv4 & IPv6 address assigned to EC2 instance.

    - userdata(scripts and userinfo) vs metadata

    - Hyberinate - only storage and IP is charged


ELB - ELB can only balance traffic in one region and not across multiple regions.

    - ELB cannot span across regions

    - Elastic Load Balancing uses a TLS negotiation configuration, known as a security policy, 
      to negotiate TLS connections between a client and the load balancer. A security policy is a combination of protocols and ciphers

        -  cipher is an encryption algorithm that uses encryption keys to create a coded message.
           Protocols use several ciphers to encrypt data over the internet


max 100 buckets per account


EFS - data is reduntantly stored in multiAZ
    - 1000+ instances concurrent
    - big data, media processing

    - While mounting Amazon EFS, if encryption of data in transit is enabled,
      EFS Mount helper initialise client Stunnel process to encrypt data in transit. EFS Mount helper uses TLS 1.2 to encrypts data in transit.




Cloud trail logs are encrypted automatically

Redshift has a cross region snapshot option


ECS features - Containers and Images, Task Definitions, Tasks and Scheduling, Clusters, Container Agent
        
        task Definition - JSON template - contains - docker image to be used, Ec2 instance type, CPU and memory to be used

        ecs Container instances - no access to OS, monitoring enabled

        service Definition - a long JSON template - contains Cluster, service name, task def, service registeries, roles

        Ecs - allows to pass user data to the instance

        Ecs montoring - cloud watch, logs - cloud trail

If you use HTTPS (SSL or TLS) for your front-end listener, you must deploy an SSL/TLS certificate on your load balancer. 
The load balancer uses the certificate to terminate the connection and then decrypt requests from clients before sending them to the instances.

EBS - General purpose SSD - 3 IOPS/GiB, with the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS for extended periods of time
    - provisioned IOPS - 64,000 IOPS and 1,000 MB/s of throughput. 
    - Encryption by default is a Region-specific setting.
    - Newly created EBS resources are encrypted by your account's default customer master key (CMK)
      unless you specify a customer managed CMK in the EC2 settings or at launch
    - A snapshot is constrained to the AWS Region where it was created.
        After you create a snapshot of an EBS volume, you can use it to create new volumes in the same Region

    - data is reduntantly stored in single multiAZ
    - single access

AWS CodeDeploy is a service that automates code deployments to currently running EC2 instances - while launching new would require beanstalk

cloudformation - template - parameters - vpc, subnets,instance type,ssh location
                          - mappings - region to link, instance to values(m2 large)
                          - resources - notification topic, webserver grp, policiy, launch config, CPU
                          - outputs - url

Route 53 - Hosted zones - Public hosted zones contain records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet
                        - Private hosted zones contain records that specify how you want to route traffic in an Amazon VPC
        

AWS config - configurations of your AWS resources. Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource configurations and 
             allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations

AWS SSO - When two-way trust relationships are created between AWS Managed Microsoft AD and an on-premises Active Directory, 
          on-premises users can sign in with their corporate credentials to various AWS services and business applications

        - AD Connector is a directory gateway that can redirect directory requests to your on-premises Active Directory 
          without caching any information in the cloud

        - If you are connecting AWS SSO to an AD Connector directory, any future user password resets must be done from within Active Directory. 
          This means that users will not be able to reset their passwords from the user portal.

        - With Context-aware two step verification, AWS SSO analyse user sign-in context such as browser, location & devices, 
          & if any deviation is observed,only then it asks for additional second level of verification code. 
          With this, a user does not have to perform two-step verification repeatedly from same device.

lambda - Environment variables for Lambda functions enable you to dynamically pass settings to your function code and libraries, 
         without making changes to your code. Environment variables are key-value pairs that you create and modify as part 
         of your function configuration, using either the AWS Lambda Console

VPC endpoints - only for S3 and DynamoDB for others we use 

VPC private links - Interface VPC endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, an AWS technology that enables private communication
                    between AWS services using an elastic network interface with private IPs in your Amazon VPC
