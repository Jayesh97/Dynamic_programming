if declared as int * etext --- we shift by 4 bytes when we do ++


where is etext and all those defined ??? by compiler


xenu - 
    - everything in kernel mode
    -we dont have system call numbers

in other os which run in usermode-so sys call will call interrupt handler

address translation done by H/w

where in address?
    data - gobal var
    stack -local
    heap - malloc()


TCP incast problem in Datacenter
    - all workers responding at same time

TCP outcast


Long-tail end-end delay
    losing 1 packet - will make all 99 packets to keep delayed

coflow scheduling for the solution



wget compied to c/windows/system32


x = x+1
we need 5 physical address 
rbp - stack based reister value
fetch instruction also takes memory
page table - to translate virtual to physical

why 4,3?
translate of virtual to phy - static relocation, no protection - disadvantage
to cover it, we use dynamic relocation

Base - offset is stored her -diff physical registers

examples of Hw features leveraged by OS??

1400 - exception, because we can only go to 1023

stack address translation happens in reverse direction

In address translation - base of the stack is mapped to the max address+1 - 12k-1+1

c00 - 11 00000 00000 - 3*1024 - 3kb
1000 - 0001 00 00000 00000 - 4*1024 - 4kb

bisection bw - min bw bn 2 halves
oversubscription ratio

0x7000 0x0800

range of valid - 0x7000 - base
                - 0x0800  bounds

                virtual add - 0x2800 --  0x2FFF
                physical -    0x6800 -- 6xfff


virt add - 0x2100 base - 0x7800  bounds - 0x1000

when we call free - lib will record the size, we need not pass
            how will lib know?
                Goes back 8 bytes and checks - Time : <12.16>

segmentaion - contguios in both physical and virtual
paging - c in only virt

magic no, changes to the pointer value

sudo virt-install -n t11_vm8 --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/t11_vm8.img,size=256 --ram=24576 --vcpus=4 --cpu host --cdrom /home/eb2-2027/ubuntu-18.04.3-live-server-amd64.iso  --network network=default --network network=l2_bridge --network network=l3_bridge --network network=t_bridge -v
