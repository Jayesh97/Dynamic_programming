## Is ICMP part of IP ?

ICMP uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher level protocol, however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP. Although ICMP messages are contained within standard IP packets, ICMP messages are usually processed as a special case, distinguished from normal IP processing

ICMP is directly linked to the IP header, which is marked by the protocol number 1 or 58 (ICMPv6) in the IP field “protocol”
